# **App Name**: Visionary Prompter

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: User uploads an image to the app.
- Image Analysis: Leverage a pre-trained image analysis model (using generative AI) to analyze the uploaded image and generate a detailed text description. The LLM will use reasoning as a tool to decide when and if to incorporate information like objects, colors, and styles detected in the image.
- Prompt Generation: Generate a prompt optimized for the Flux.1 Dev model, based on the image analysis. The LLM will use reasoning as a tool to choose the wording most likely to create images matching the uploaded picture. User can select to use Gemini or Gemma which is free without API key
- Prompt Display: Display the generated prompt to the user, with an option to copy it.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Medium purple (#A091D3), providing a modern and imaginative feel, inspired by AI innovation.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F5), offering a neutral backdrop that ensures the purple stands out while maintaining a clean interface.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#D6B4FC), adding a gentle highlight for interactive elements, complementing the primary color without overwhelming the user.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a computerized, techy, scientific feel. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), used for body to improve readability.
- Use simple, line-based icons that relate to image processing and prompt generation. Icons should be consistent in style and weight, and use the lavender accent color for highlights.
- A clean, modular layout that emphasizes usability. The image upload area and the prompt display area should be clearly delineated, with plenty of whitespace to avoid a cluttered appearance.
- Subtle animations, like a smooth fade-in for the generated prompt or a loading animation while the image is being analyzed, to enhance user experience without being distracting.
